## Rules
### Basic Play
Each player starts with one unit of land, ten AirPods (AP), and twenty "valued employees" (that is, slaves). Each "day" (the game can be played at any rate), a player will generate one airpod for each slave. They can then buy slaves for 5AP and land for 10AP. A player can only have 25 slaves per unit of land. Once all [NUMBER] (this number can be changed) units of land have been bought, the player with the most land is the winner.
